# Maock is an http1 / http2 mock server
  
  Maock was forked from asio-sv of nghttp2, with configuration interface added, to enable it to mock many http1 / http2 services with simple configuration, while for most cases, it does not require any programing skills from the end user.
 
  Maock supports programing interface as well, to further customized the response message with Lua.
  
  Maock support mTLS.
  
  Maock supports both Linux and Windows natively.
  
# How Maock works / Usage 

  Maock supports Json file to customize mock services.
 
  First, open a GUI Json editor, for example, https://pmk65.github.io/jedemov2/dist/demo.html
 
  Then paste Maock Json schema file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallyatgithub/maock/main/H2Server_Config_Schema.json
  
  into the text box under "Schema" tab, and then click "Generate Form" button, which would produce a form named h2server_configuration
 
  Edit the form; check the text under each field for the description of each field.
  
  Configuration overview：
 
  In Maock configuration, each mock service is represented by a "Service" entry.
  
  Each Service has a "Request", and an group of "Response".
  
  Each "Request" defines a set of rule to match the incoming request message.
  
  A match rule could be:
  
  Header value match, i.e., a certain header value starts with / ends with / contains / equals to some certain keyword.
   
  Payload match. With Json pointer, Maock can locate a value in the incoming Json payload, so a payload match rule could be:
  
  Some value (identified by a certain Json pointer) in the Json payload starts with / ends with / contains / equals to some certain keyword.
  
  When the incoming request message passes all the matching rules that a "Request" defines, the "Response" associated with the "Request", may be chosen to generate the response message.
  
  It is possible to define and load multiple "Service" entries, and Maock will chose the one that best fits.
  
  Best fit, means, when there are more than one "Request" can match the incoming request message, then the "Request" with more matching rules will be chosen as matched.

  Then one "Response" from the respective "Response" group, is picked up to generate the final outgoing response messsage.
  
  As for which "Response" is picked up, it is determined by the weights of the "Response" in the same group.
  
  Of course, you can define one single "Response" instead of several, for each "Request", then, this "Response" is always picked up if the "Request" is matched
  
  "Response" has a list of configuration fields available to customize the actual response:

  1. status-code, such as 201, 200, 204, etc.
 
  2. The outgoing message payload; it could be a piece of Json data, or some data in other format. 
  
     As told by the description of the msg-payload field, msg-payload can have placeholders for variables.
     
     Each placeholder is associated with an argument that follows in "Arguments" field.
    
     Each argument produces a string, to replace the placeholder in the payload, i.e., string generated by first argument would replace the first placeholder occurance, and that of the second argument would replace the second occurance, and so on.
     
     There are different sources from which an argument produce the string:
     
     From a certain header value of the incoming message, such as the :path header value
     
     From a certain value (identified by Json pointer) in the Json payload of the incoming message
     
     A sub string action can be done to the target value above, to get only a portion of the string. For example, to get the user Id from the :path header.
     
     Other sources to produce a string might be added when needed. Please refer to the scheme to get a complete list.
     
  3. Headers of the outgoing response message.
  
     A header is defined as a string, with colon (:) as the delimeter, with header name before the colon and header value following the colon.
     
     Like payload, a header value can also have placeholders for variable replacement by argument. It works exactly the same with that of payload.
     
  4. A Lua script to further customize the response headers and response payload generated above.

     If this is desired, a piece of Lua script, or a file containing the script, should be provided to "luaScript" field of "Response". 

     The script should have a function named "customize_response", which takes 4 arguments: request_headers (table), request_payload, response_headers (table), response_payload
     
     The script can define other lua functions, and function "customize_response" can call that. It can also "require" another lua module, the respective lua file required can be placed in the same directory of maock executable, or any other directory that is within LUA_PATH

     The customize_response function can make whatever update to response_headers and response_payload, and then return them two.
     
     Maock will pick up the updated response_headers and response_payload, and send back in the response message.
     
     Different "Response" can have different customize_response scripts for best flexibility.
    
     An example of the customize_response function:
     
    function customize_response(request_header, request_payload, response_headers_to_send, response_payload_to_send)
        response_headers_to_send["test"] = "test_value"
        response_payload_to_send = "hello lua"
        return response_headers_to_send, response_payload_to_send
    end

     maock has some utility functions builtin, they are:
     
     **store_value**
     
     It takes 2 arguments, first is the key which is a string, second is also a string which is the value. This function will store the key-value pair into the global map shared by by all worker threads. Note: this global map is protected by a mutex, and would result in performance degradation, so use this only if it is indeed necessary, e.g., data sharing accross differernt worker threads.
     
     **get_value**
     
     It takes 1 arguments, the key, which is a string; it returns the value, which is a string, if the key-value exists in the global map shared by all worker threads, otherwise, it returns nil.
     
     **delete_value**
     
     It takes 1 arguments, the key, which is a string; if the key-value pair exists in the global map shared by all worker threads, it will delete the key-value pair from the global map and return the value as a string, otherwise, it returns nil.
     
     **generate_uuid_v4**
     It takes no argument, returning 1 string, which is a v4 uuid of 32 bits randomness.
     
     **time_since_epoch**
     
     time_since_epoch takes no argument, but it returns the milliseconds since the clock's epoch (may NOT necessarily to be 1970)
     
     maock also has some third party modules builtin, which are directly made available with the need of "require".
     
     Currently these modules are made available:
     
     protobuf modules: https://github.com/starwing/lua-protobuf/blob/master/README.md
     
     rapidjson modules: https://github.com/xpol/lua-rapidjson/blob/master/API.md
     
     Other lua modules *written in Lua* can also be loaded with "require", as long as the respective .lua file can be found in current directory or LUA_PATH.
     
     Currently, .so lua modules cannot be loaded with "require", but they can be builtin and made available if necessary, like rapidjson.

  After finish editing the form, copy the data of the left edit box under the "Output" tab, and save into a file, such as maock.json
  
  Then start Maock with maock.json as the input: 
 
    maock maock.json

# How to have a quick try

  Download the pre-built Maock executable for Windows or linux respectively from https://github.com/wallyatgithub/maock/releases
  
  Unzip/Untar, then run it:

  ./maock ./maock.json # for linux
  
  or
  
  maock.exe maock.json # for windows 10
  
  Now Maock is up and running on port 8081 with the sample rules.
 
  Download the pre-built H2loadrunner executable for Windows or linux respectively from https://github.com/wallyatgithub/h2loadrunner/releases
  
  Unzip/Untar, then run it:
  
  ./h2loadrunner --config-file=./h2load.json # for linux
  
  or
  
  h2loadrunner.exe --config-file=h2load.json # for windows 10
  
  Now H2loadrunner is up and sending test traffic through 2 connections to Maock, each connection has request per second = 100.
  
  Check the output of Maock and H2loadrunner for the ongoing traffic statistics.

# How to build Maock from the source：

  Maock has dependency on openssl, rapidJson, boost, nghttp2, libluajit-5.1-dev.
  
  Install the dependencies with package managers like yum or apt, and then use cmake to build Maock.
  
  Maock also provides 2 docker files to build docker images with Maock.
  
  Dockerfile_CentOS7: CentOS 7 based docker image
  
  Dockerfile_Ubuntu: Ubuntu latest based docker image

# How to build Maock on Windows

  cmake 3.20 or later, Visual Studio 2022 MSVC x86/x64 build tool, and windows 10 SDK need to be installed first

  vcpkg is also needed. Please follow https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html to install and set up vcpkg
  
  These dependency packages need to be installed to vcpkg:
  
    boost:x64-windows
    getopt:x64-windows
    openssl:x64-windows
    luajit:x64-windows
    nghttp2:x64-windows
    rapidjson:x64-windows
  
  Next, download maock source with http or git, for example, maock is downloaded to c:\tmp
  
  Then, 
  
    Open "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt" from start menu
    
    C:\tmp>cd maock
    
    C:\tmp\maock>mkdir build
    
    C:\tmp\maock>cd build
    
    C:\tmp\maock\build>cmake ../ -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=_REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_VCPKG_PATH_\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    
    Make sure to replace _REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_VCPKG_PATH_ with your actual vcpkg path.
    
    Opitonally, add -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static for x64 static link (dependency packages of x64-windows-static triplet should be installed to vcpkg)
    
    C:\tmp\maock\build>cmake --build ./ --config=Release
  
  maock.exe will then be generated
  
# What is the throughput of Maock:

  For different configurations, less or more "Service", simple or complex matching rules or arguments, Maock behaves differently, so the throughput may vary.
  
  Here the performance data of such a typical configuration is given:
  
  Configuration：
  
    The "Request" has a match rule to :path header, a match rule to user-agent header, and a match rule to the Json message payload.
  
    The "Response" has three headers with four arguments in total, in which three arguments are based on incoming message, and the rest is a random hex.
  
  With such configuration, Maock can reach 20K TPS with only 1 vCPU.
  
  While Maock supports multi-threading, so its throughput can linearly grow with multicore.
