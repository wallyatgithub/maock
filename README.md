# Maock is an http2 mock server
  
  It was forked from asio-sv of nghttp2,  with configuration support added, to make it able to mock many http2 services, especially those with Json payload.
  
  More information is available in README.zh-cn.md. Translation to English is to be done later.

# How Maock works 

  Maock supports Json file to customize mock services.
 
  First, open a GUI Json editor, for example, https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/
  
  Select "material-ui" in the up right dropbox for a better view of the layers of the configuration
 
  Then paste Maock Json schema file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallyatgithub/maock/main/H2Server_Config_Schema.json
  
  into the text box named "JSONSchema", which would produce a form named h2server_configuration on the right side,
  
  Clear all text in textbox "UISchema" and "formData",
 
  Edit the form; check the text under each field for the description of each field.
  
  Configuration overview：
 
  In Maock configuration, each mock service is represented by a "Service" entry.
  
  Each Service has a "Request", and a "Response".
  
  Each "Request" defines a set of rule to match the incoming request message.
  
  A match rule could be:
  
  Header value match, i.e., a certain header value starts with / ends with / contains / equals to some certain keyword.
   
  Payload match. With Json pointer, Maock can locate a value in the incoming Json payload, so a payload match rule could be:
  
  Some value (identified by a certain Json pointer) in the Json payload starts with / ends with / contains / equals to some certain keyword.
  
  When the incoming request message passes all the matching rules that a "Request" defines, then the "Response" associated with the "Request", would be chosen to generate the response message.
  
  "Response" has a list of configuration fields available to customize the actual response:

  1. status-code, such as 201, 200, 204, etc.
 
  2. The outgoing message payload; it could be a piece of Json data, or some data in other format. 
  
     As told by the description of the msg-payload field, msg-payload can have placeholders for variables.
     
     Each placeholder is associated with an argument that follows in "Arguments" field.
    
     Each argument produces a string, to replace the placeholder in the payload, i.e., string generated by first argument would replace the first placeholder occurance, and that of the second argument would replace the second occurance, and so on.
     
     There are different sources from which an argument produce the string:
     
     From a certain header value of the incoming message, such as the :path header value
     
     From a certain value (identified by Json pointer) in the Json payload of the incoming message
     
     A sub string action can be done to the target value above, to get only a portion of the string. For example, to get the user Id from the :path header.
     
     The other source to produce a string, is to produce a random hex. By chaining a list of these actions, Maock can produce a string similar to a UUID, like the subscription Id in the response message.
     
  3. Headers of the outgoing response message.
  
     A header is defined as a string, with colon (:) as the delimeter, with header name before the colon and header value following the colon.
     
     Like payload, a header value can also have placeholders for variable replacement by argument. It works exactly the same with that of payload.
     
  It is possible to define and load multiple "Service" entries, and Maock will chose the one that best fits to find the corresponding "Response"
  
  Best fit, means, when there are more than one "Requst" can match the incoming request message, then the "Request" with more matching rules will be chosen as matched, and thus the corresponding "Response" is used to produce the outgoing response messsage.
  
  While the second "Request" has a match rule to :path header, and another matching rule to Json message payload.
  
  The incoming request matches both :header rule, and it also match the Json payload rule of the second "Request", then the second "Request" is chosen as matched, and "Response" associated with it, is used to produce the outgoing response messsage.
  
  
  After finish editing the form, copy the data from the textbox named "formData", and save into a file, such as maock.json
  
  Then start Maock with maock.json as the input: 
 
    maock maock.json
  
  You can choose other Json editors as well, such as:

# How to build Maock from the source：

  Maock has dependency on openssl, rapidJson, boost, nghttp2.
  
  Install the dependencies with package managers like yum or apt, and then use cmake to build Maock.
  
  Maock also provides 2 docker files to build docker images with Maock.
  
  Dockerfile_CentOS7: CentOS 7 based docker image
  
  Dockerfile_Ubuntu: Ubuntu latest based docker image

  
# What is the throughput of Maock:

  For different configurations, less or more "Service", simple or complex matching rules or arguments, Maock behaves differently, so the throughput may vary.
  
  Here the performance data of such a typical configuration is given:
  
  Configuration：
  
    The "Request" has a match rule to :path header, a match rule to user-agent header, and a match rule to the Json message payload.
  
    The "Response" has three headers with four arguments in total, in which three arguments are based on incoming message, and the rest is a random hex.
  
  With such configuration, Maock can reach 20K TPS with only 1 vCPU.
  
  While Maock supports multi-threading, so its throughput can linearly grow with multicore.
